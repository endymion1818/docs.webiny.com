- how to modify cloud infrastructure deployed by Webiny, using Pulumi

</Alert>

## Overview

Users use the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command to deploy their Webiny project, into an [environment](/docs/{version}//core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment#environments) of their choice. During the deployment, apart from building the actual applications, the [Webiny CLI](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/webiny-cli) also ensures that a set of supporting cloud infrastructure resources is deployed.

And although the cloud infrastructure resources that Webiny deploys are already configured in the best possible manner, there are still cases where some modifications might be needed. In some cases even, the deployed cloud infrastructure needs to be expanded by introducing additional resources into the mix.

To do this, we rely on four `webiny.application.ts` configuration files, located in each of the four project application folders in every Webiny project:

1. **Core** ([`apps/core/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.29.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/ddb/apps/core/webiny.application.ts)
2. **API** ([`apps/api/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.29.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/ddb/apps/api/webiny.application.ts)
3. **Admin** ([`apps/admin/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.29.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/admin/webiny.application.ts)
4. **Website** ([`apps/website/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.29.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/website/webiny.application.ts)

Which `webiny.application.ts` config file needs to be changed depends on the nature of the change that needs to be made.

For example, let's imagine we want to adjust the configuration of the Amazon S3 bucket that's deployed for storing files uploaded via Webiny File Manager. Since this bucket is deployed as part of the **Core** project application, naturally, we'd want to apply changes via the [`apps/core/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.29.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/ddb/apps/core/webiny.application.ts) configuration file.

The following example demonstrates how the bucket can be adjusted to enable [object versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html), which essentially enables keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket:

```ts apps/core/webiny.application.ts
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import { createCoreApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";

export default createCoreApp({
  pulumi: app => {
    const { fileManagerBucket } = app.resources;
    fileManagerBucket.config.versioning({ enabled: true });
  }
});
```

As we can see, via the `pulumi` property, we've defined a relatively simple callback function that enables object versioning in two steps:

1. references the relevant bucket via the `fileManagerBucket` const
2. uses the reference to enable bucket versioning, via the `fileManagerBucket.config.versioning`

Once the above code change has been made, all that is left to do is a redeploy by running the following command:

```bash
# Make sure to replace {env} with the actual name of the environment.
yarn webiny deploy apps/core --env {env}
```

With the deployment successfully completed, the object versioning should be enabled for your project (for all files that are uploaded via Webiny File Manager).

<Alert type="info">

When redeploying, make sure to redeploy the project application within which the changes were actually made. In the above example, we've made changes within the **Core** application's `webiny.application.ts` file, meaning the **Core** application needs to be redeployed in order to actually see the changes.

## Additional Examples

In this section, we cover a couple of additional examples of modifying the Webiny cloud infrastructure.

### Adding Tags to All Cloud Infrastructure Resources

The following example shows how to apply tags to all cloud infrastructure resources deployed as part of the **Core** project application. Note that the same approach can be used for all four applications.

```ts apps/core/webiny.application.ts
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import { createCoreApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";
import { tagResources } from "@webiny/pulumi-aws";

export default createCoreApp({
  pulumi: app => {
    // We are assigning Owner and Contact tags, whose values 
    // are read from runtime environment variables.
    tagResources({
      Owner: String(process.env["OWNER"]),
      Contact: String(process.env["CONTACT"])
    });
  }
});
```

### Adjusting Amazon Elasticsearch (OpenSearch) Configuration

Amazon Elasticsearch (OpenSearch) is deployed as part of the **Core** project application. In order to make changes to it, we need to make changes in the `apps/core/webiny.application.ts` configuration file.

```ts apps/core/webiny.application.ts
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import { createCoreApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";
import { isResourceOfType } from "@webiny/pulumi";

export default createCoreApp({
  elasticSearch: true,

  pulumi: app => {
    app.onResource(resource => {
      if (isResourceOfType(resource, aws.elasticsearch.Domain)) {
        // Set the instance type.
        resource.config.clusterConfig(() => {
          return {
            instanceType: "t3.small.elasticsearch"
          };
        });

        // Set Elasticsearch (OpenSearch) version.
        resource.config.elasticsearchVersion("7.7");

        // Change advanced options.
        resource.config.advancedOptions({
          override_main_response_version: "false",
          "rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index": "true"
        });

        resource.opts.ignoreChanges = ["advancedOptions", "tags"];
      }
    });
  }
});
```
