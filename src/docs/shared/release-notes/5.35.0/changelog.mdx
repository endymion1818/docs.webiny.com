## Lambda Functions

### Removing the Headless CMS Lambda ([#2945](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2945))
<Alert type="warning">

In the 5.35.0 we are removing the Headless CMS Lambda from the deployment.

</Alert>

<Alert type="danger">

For this to work, the user will need to have the new project setup, which is available since the `5.29.0` version.
  
If a user does not have the new project setup, they should not be upgrading to the `5.35.0` version.

</Alert>

This is a breaking change as users will need to move all their existing custom plugins and code, imported in the `apps/api/headlessCMS/src/index.ts` and `apps/api/headlessCMS/src/security.ts` folder, to the `apps/api/graphql/src/index.ts` and `apps/api/graphql/src/security.ts`.

Users will also need to change any custom Pulumi code, which currently uses the Headless CMS Lambda.

We cannot do that automatically for users, because the probability for some error to happen is very high.
This should not be a problem for most of our users, but if there are any - we are available for help on our [Community Slack](https://webiny-community.slack.com/).

The reason behind this is to simplify the deployment and development process.

The `/graphql` and `/cms` routes remain the same, as we internally map routes to the Lambda, so users do not need to worry about those.

Due to this change, in both `/graphql` and `/cms` routes, all the applications are available on the `context` object.
