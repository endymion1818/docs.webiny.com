## Lambda Functions

### Removing the Headless CMS Lambda Function ([#2945](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2945))

<Alert type="warning">

In the 5.35.0 we are removing the Headless CMS Lambda function from the deployment. This is a breaking change, but it is quite simple to fix.

</Alert>

Starting with the `5.35.0` release, there is only a single Lambda Function which handles the requests - the one called GraphQL (`apps/api/graphql`).

We removed the Headless CMS Lambda Function to simplify the development and deployment process for the users.

To learn how to fix the code breaks, please follow the [Upgrade Guide](/docs/release-notes/5.35.0/upgrade-guide).
