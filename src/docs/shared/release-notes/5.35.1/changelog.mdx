## Page Builder

### Editing Template Variables In Page Editor Now Works as Expected ([#3286](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3286))

Prior to this release, editing values of template variables in Page Builder's page editor would not work as expected. This has now been addressed.

## Deployments

### Website's Lambda@Edge Function Is No Longer Destroyed Automatically ([#3278](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3278))

When Webiny's [multi-tenancy](/docs/enterprise/multi-tenancy) feature is enabled, as part of the **Website** project application, Webiny deploys an additional [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/) function, which is used for additional multi-tenancy-related routing purposes.

From this release, this function is no longer automatically destroyed when destroying the project application. It must be destroyed manually, either via the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), or via the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

This is because of an AWS limitation, which does not allow the immediate deletion of Lambda@Edge functions. Trying to immediately delete the function will result in an error, which is why Webiny does not attempt to delete it automatically.

<Alert type={"info"}>

Note that Lambda@Edge functions are always deployed into `us-east-1` region. Make sure it is selected in the AWS
Console, or via the AWS CLI, before proceeding with the deletion.
