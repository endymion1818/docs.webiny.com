## Page Builder

### Lexical Error Issue ([#3325](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3325))

With the 5.36.0 release, we've addressed a couple of Lexical-related usability issues. Unfortunately, we've also introduced an issue that would cause content created with the previous version of the editor to not load properly.

With this release, the Lexical content that was created prior to 5.36.0 version of Webiny should load as expected.

### Website Settings - Fixed Theme Selector ([#3331](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3331))

In a multi-theme setup, at the end of the Website Settings form, the select component that would enable users to pick a theme for the current tenant wasn't working as expected. On page load, the select component would be simply empty and not showing the value that was previously selected.

The select component now works as expected.
