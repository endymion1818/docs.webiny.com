## Page Builder

### Improved

With the 5.36.0 release, we've addressed a couple of Lexical-related usability issues. Unfortunately, we've also introduced an issue that would cause content created with the previous version of the editor to not get displayed.

With this release, the Lexical content that was created prior to 5.36.0 version of Webiny should displayed as expected.

## Development

### The `webiny about` Command ([#3351](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3351))

With this release, we're introducing the `webiny about` command, which displays a plethora of information about the Webiny project you're currently working on.

In some cases, the output of this command might help us troubleshoot your issues faster, so please make sure to include the output of this command when you're reporting an issue.
