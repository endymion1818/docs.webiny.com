## File Manager

### Introducing Advanced Content Organization for File Manager ([#3312](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3312))

The Advanced Content Organization (ACO) for File Manager is a new feature that provides users with the ability to organize content in an effective, easy-to-manage way. The ACO allows users to add files in separate folders and rearrange content as needed, making it easier to find what they are looking for.

**With the new File Manager users can:**

1. Create and update a multi-level folder structure.
2. Switch to "Table" mode, having a nice overview on the most important file data, such as "Name", "Type", "Size", "Last modified" and "Author". 
3. Sort both folders and files based on "Name" and "Last Modified". This feature makes it easier for users to find specific files and folders quickly.
4. Move a files across the hierarchy tree, and it has no impact on the file URL. The two have been decoupled to ensure users have the flexibility they need without having a negative impact on SEO if they decide to restructure their folder/file organization.
