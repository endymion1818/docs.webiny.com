## Development

### Watch Command - Removed Redundant Logs ([#2603](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2603))

When running the [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command with the [logs forwarding option](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command#enabling-logs-forwarding), except for the actual logs, developers would also receive the underlying local tunnel URL, over which the logs would get forwarded to the developer's machine.

With this release, the redundant URL won't be appearing anymore. 

### CI/CD Scaffold - Workflow Files Are Now Correctly Deployed ([#2601](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2601))

Prior to this PR, upon using the [CI/CD scaffold](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/ci-cd/setup), the designated GitHub Actions workflow files would not be correctly generated in developer's GitHub repository. 

This has now been addressed, so all of the GitHub Actions workflow files should be generated correctly.

### Watch Command - Add `hook-before-watch` Hook ([#2607](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2607))

We've introduced the new `hook-before-watch` lifecycle event to the [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command. 

The [Build and Deploy Hooks](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/basics/build-and-deploy-hooks) has been updated to reflect this change, so check it out to learn more.  

### Ensure WCP-related Environment Variables Are Correctly Assigned With the Watch Command ([#2609](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2609))

While using the [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command, we've noticed that the relevant Webiny Control Panel (WCP) environment variables would get removed from the previously deployed AWS Lambda functions, which causes the link between developer's Webiny project and WCP to be temporarily broken.

This has now been addressed. The link between the Webiny project and WCP should stay persistent, no matter if the project has been deployed via the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command, or a developer is just doing development with the [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command.
