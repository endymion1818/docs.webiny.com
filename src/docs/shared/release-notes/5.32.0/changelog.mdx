## Development

### Watch Command - Removed Redundant Logs ([#2603](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2603))

When running the [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command with the [logs forwarding option](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command#enabling-logs-forwarding), except for the actual logs, developers would also receive the underlying local tunnel URL, over which the logs would get forwarded to the developer's machine.

With this release, the redundant URL won't be appearing anymore. 

### Destroy Command Now Works Even If the Project Wasn't Previously Deployed

With this release, we've fixed an issue with the [`webiny destroy`](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/basics/destroy-cloud-infrastructure) command, where, in order for it to work correctly, a Webiny project application had to be previously deployed.

This is no longer the case. A Webiny project application doesn't need to be previously deployed in order for the command to work.

Thanks goes to [@ryohei-kamiya](https://github.com/ryohei-kamiya) for discovering this issue! ❤️

### CI/CD Scaffold - Workflow Files Are Now Correctly Deployed ([#2601](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2601))

Prior to this release, upon using the [CI/CD scaffold](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/ci-cd/setup), the GitHub Actions workflow files would not be correctly generated in developer's GitHub repository. 

This has now been addressed. All of the GitHub Actions workflow files should be generated correctly.

### Watch Command - Introduced the `hook-before-watch` Lifecycle Event ([#2607](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2607))

We've introduced the new `hook-before-watch` lifecycle event to the [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command. 

The [Build and Deploy Hooks](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/basics/build-and-deploy-hooks) has been updated to reflect this change, so check it out to learn more.  

### Ensure WCP-related Environment Variables Are Correctly Assigned With the Watch Command ([#2609](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2609))

While using the [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command, we've noticed that the relevant Webiny Control Panel (WCP) environment variables would get removed from the previously deployed AWS Lambda functions, which causes the link between developer's Webiny project and WCP to be temporarily broken.

This has now been addressed. The link between the Webiny project and WCP should stay persistent, no matter if the project has been deployed via the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command, or a developer is just doing development with the [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command.
