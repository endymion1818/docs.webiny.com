## Development

### Webiny Production Mode - All AWS Lambda Functions Are Now Assigned to VPC ([#2798](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2798))

When deploying your Webiny project in [production mode](/docs/{version}/architecture/introduction#development-and-production-deployment-modes), for better security posture, all AWS Lambda functions are deployed into a [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) with private subnets.

And while our initial intention was to have this cloud infrastructure configuration automatically be applied when a project is being [deployed](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment#the-deploy-command) into the production environment, due to a issue in an internal Webiny package, that just wasn't the case.

With this release, the issue has been resolved. You can expect all of the relevant AWS Lambda functions to be correctly deployed into a VPC when deploying your project into the production environment.
