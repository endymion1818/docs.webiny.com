## Overview

### Access theme via context

✍🏻

### Use `mq` Utility Function For Easier Styling

One of the tools that is recommended in [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) library's documentation portal is [Facepaint](https://github.com/emotion-js/facepaint). The library enables the developer to easily define CSS rules for multiple pre-defined breakpoints, for example:

```ts
import { css } from "emotion";
import facepaint from "facepaint";

const mq = facepaint([
  "@media(min-width: 420px)",
  "@media(min-width: 920px)",
  "@media(min-width: 1120px)"
]);

const myClassName = css(
  mq({
    color: ["red", "green", "blue", "darkorchid"]
  })
);
```

With this 5.35.0 release, this library is included in the [`@webiny/app-page-builder-elements`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/dev/packages/app-page-builder-elements) package, enabling users to immediately use it, without the need to install it first. Furthermore, by importing the `mq` utility function, users can immediately start writing their per-breakpoint styles, because the function is already configured to follow the breakpoints defined in the [theme](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/dev/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts). For example:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { mq } from "@webiny/app-page-builder-elements";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

// Basic usage.
export const HeroSection = styled("div")(() =>
  mq({ color: ["red", "green", "blue", "gray", "white"] })
);

// With theme being accessed via the `theme` argument:
export const HeroSectionWithTheme = styled("div")(
  {
    lineHeight: "125%",
    backgroundColor: "#fff",
    backgroundRepeat: "no-repeat"
  },
  ({ theme }) =>
    mq({
      color: [
        "red",
        theme.styles.colors.color1,
        theme.styles.colors.color2,
        theme.styles.colors.color3,
        theme.styles.colors.color4
      ]
    })
);
```
