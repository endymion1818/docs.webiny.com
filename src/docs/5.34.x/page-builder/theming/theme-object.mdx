## Overview

The theme object defines different visual aspects of our website, for example the default set of colors, typography, breakpoints, and more.

Apart from being used in the code by different page elements, the theme object is also integrated with different editors that are available in the Page Builder's application, like page or block editor. For example, colors or different typography options defined in the theme object are automatically picked up by these editors, enabling users to select them while building content and ensuring everything stays visually consistent.

By default, the theme object is exported from the [`apps/theme/index.ts`](#) file, and it looks like the following:

```ts apps/theme/theme.ts
// Parts of code removed for brevity.
import { createTheme } from "@webiny/app-theme";
import { CSSObject } from "@emotion/react";

// Breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile).
export const breakpoints = {
    desktop: "@media (max-width: 4000px)",
    tablet: "@media (max-width: 991px)",
    "mobile-landscape": "@media (max-width: 767px)",
    "mobile-portrait": "@media (max-width: 478px)"
};

// Colors.
export const colors = {
    color1: "#fa5723", // Primary.
    color2: "#00ccb0", // Secondary.
    color3: "#0a0a0a", // Text primary.
    color4: "#616161", // Text secondary.
    color5: "#eaecec", // Background.
    color6: "#ffffff" // White background.
};

// Fonts.
export const fonts = {
    font1: "'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;", // Primary.
    font2: "'Lato', sans-serif;" // Secondary.
};

// Border radius.
export const borderRadius = 4;

// Typography.
const headings = {
    fontFamily: fonts.font2,
    color: colors.color3,
    WebkitFontSmoothing: "antialiased"
};

const paragraphs = {
    fontFamily: fonts.font1,
    color: colors.color3,
    fontWeight: 400,
    lineHeight: 1.35,
    WebkitFontSmoothing: "antialiased"
};

export const typography = {
    heading1: { ...headings, fontWeight: "bold", fontSize: 48 },
    heading2: { ...headings, fontSize: 36 },
    heading3: { ...headings, fontSize: 30 },
    heading4: { ...headings, fontSize: 24 },
    heading5: { ...headings, fontSize: 20 },
    heading6: { ...headings, fontSize: 18, lineHeight: "1.75rem" },
    paragraph1: { ...paragraphs, fontSize: 16.5 },
    paragraph2: {
        ...paragraphs,
        fontSize: 12.5,
        letterSpacing: "0.45px",
        lineHeight: "19px"
    },
    quote: {
        ...paragraphs,
        fontWeight: "bold",
        fontSize: 22
    },
    list: { ...paragraphs, fontSize: 17 }
} as const;

// Buttons.
const buttons = (overrides: CSSObject) => ({
   // Code removed for brevity.
});

// Theme object.
const theme = createTheme({
    breakpoints,
    styles: {
        colors,
        typography,
        elements: {
           // Code removed for brevity.
        }
    }
});

export default theme;

```

In the following text, we cover all the different properties of which the theme object consists of.

## Properties

### Breakpoints

Via the `breakpoints` property, the theme object defines four available breakpoints:

1. desktop
2. tablet
3. mobile (landscape orientation)
4. mobile (portrait orientation)

Note that the property names of these breakpoints (`desktop`, `tablet`, `mobile-landscape`, `mobile-portrait`) should not be changed. But, the assigned media queries can be adjusted and new ones can be introduced, if need be.

### Colors

Via the `styles.colors` object, the theme object defines theme colors, where property names represent the IDs of colors and values respective color codes.

The IDs of colors don't follow any naming convention. Upon introducing new colors, IDs like `primaryColor` or `myCustomColor` will work as well.

<Alert type="warning">
  Note that color IDs are used as references in pages created via the Page Builder's page editor. Meaning, changing them will cause existing pages (that are already relying on previous IDs) to break and not resolve the selected colors correctly.
</Alert>

### Typography

Via the `styles.typography` object, the theme object defines theme typography, where property names represent the IDs of typography rules and values respective CSS rules that define them visually.

Like with colors, typography IDs don't follow any naming convention. Upon introducing new typography, IDs like `primaryTypography` or `myCustomTypography` will work as well.

<Alert type="warning">
  Note that typography IDs are used as references in pages created via the Page Builder's page editor. Meaning, changing them will cause existing pages (that are already relying on previous IDs) to break and not resolve the selected typography correctly.
</Alert>

### Page Elements

Respectively, the `styles.elements` object enables defining and overriding styles for new and existing page elements. Like with colors and typography, property names represent the IDs of page elements, and values respective CSS rules that define them visually.

By default, the property contains styles for default `document`, `quote`, `button` and `list` page elements, but note that styles for custom ones can be added here as well.

<Alert type={"info"}>
  Although page elements can have their styles defined within one or more respective React components, in multi-theme projects, having all or just part of the element's styles defined here can make it easier to have different styles for different themes.
