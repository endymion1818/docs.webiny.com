## Overview

All pages created with Page Builder's page editor are rendered within a page layout.

For example, the **Static page** layout, that's by default included in every Webiny project, renders pages in a relatively standard **header** → **content** → **footer** structure.

<Image src={staticPageTemplate} title={"Static Page Layout"} shadow={false}/>

On the code level, page layouts consist of one or more React components. For example, if we were to take a look at the `Static.tsx` file, located in the `apps/theme/layouts/pages` folder, we would see the following code:

```tsx apps/theme/layouts/pages/Static.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Global, css } from "@emotion/react";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";
import { Header } from "./Static/Header";
import { Footer } from "./Static/Footer";

const globalStyles = css`
    html {
        scroll-behavior: smooth;
    }

    @media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        html {
            scroll-behavior: smooth;
        }
    }
`;

const Layout = styled.div`
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;

    footer {
        margin-top: auto;
    }
`;

const Static: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
    return (
        <Layout>
            <Global styles={globalStyles} />
            <Header />
            {/* We render the actual page content via the "children" prop. */}
            <main>{children}</main>
            <Footer />
        </Layout>
    );
};

export default Static;
```

Essentially, the file exports a page layout React component, which renders the following:

1. the page layout (notice extra components like `Layout` and `Header`)
2. the page content created via Page Builder's page editor (passed via the `children` prop)

Page layouts can be simple or complex, depending on your needs. For example, the `Static.tsx` file also contains `Header` and `Footer` components, which are used to render the header and footer of the page layout. 

Ultimately, all page layouts are registered via the [`PbPageLayoutPlugin`](#), plugin, which can be done within the `apps/theme/index.ts` file:

```diff-ts apps/theme/index.ts
import { PbPageLayoutPlugin } from "@webiny/app-page-builder";
import { FbFormLayoutPlugin } from "@webiny/app-form-builder";
import { ThemePlugin } from "@webiny/app-website";

// The central theme object which defines different visual aspects of your website,
// for example the default set of colors, typography, breakpoints, and more.
import theme from "./theme";

// Default layouts used by Page Builder pages and Form Builder forms.
+ import StaticLayout from "./layouts/pages/Static";
import DefaultFormLayout from "./layouts/forms/DefaultFormLayout";

// Ultimately, theme and layouts need to be registered via their respective plugins.
// To learn more, see: https://www.webiny.com/docs/page-builder/theming/introduction.
export default () => [
    new ThemePlugin(theme),
    
+   new PbPageLayoutPlugin({
+       name: "static",
+       title: "Static page",
+       component: StaticLayout
+   }),
    
    new FbFormLayoutPlugin({
        name: "default",
        title: "Default form layout",
        component: DefaultFormLayout
    })
];
```

The plugin is what actually makes the page layout visible in the Page Builder application and ultimately enables users to choose which layout they want to use for a specific page.

Page layouts can be assigned to pages in two ways. The first way is by selecting a default page layout for a specific page category. For example, if we wanted to assign the **Static page** layout to all pages in the **Blogs** category, upon creating the category, we would select the **Static page** layout in the **Layout** field: 

<Image src={pageBuilderLayoutSelectCategory} title={"Theme Colors"}/>

The second way is by selecting a page layout for a specific page. For example, if we wanted to assign the **Static page** layout to a specific page, we would select the **Static page** layout in the **Layout** field, located in the **Page Settings** tab:

<Image src={pageBuilderLayoutPageSettings} title={"Theme Colors"}/>


## Introducing New Page Layouts

The **Static page** page layout shown above can be used for all pages, but it's also possible to introduce new layouts and use them for different pages. All that is needed is a React component like the one above, and a `PbPageLayoutPlugin` plugin that registers the layout, which can be done via the `apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts` file.

For example, say we wanted to have a completely blank layout, that doesn't render any header or footer. We could create a new React component, and register it as a new layout via the `apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts` file:

```tsx apps/theme/layouts/pages/Blank.tsx
import React from "react";

const Blank: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
    // Simply render the "children" prop, which contains the actual page content.
    return children
};

export default Blank;
```

Then, we would register the new layout via the `apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts` file:

```diff-ts apps/theme/index.ts
import { PbPageLayoutPlugin } from "@webiny/app-page-builder";
import { FbFormLayoutPlugin } from "@webiny/app-form-builder";
import { ThemePlugin } from "@webiny/app-website";

// The central theme object which defines different visual aspects of your website,
// for example the default set of colors, typography, breakpoints, and more.
import theme from "./theme";

// Default layouts used by Page Builder pages and Form Builder forms.
import StaticLayout from "./layouts/pages/Static";
+ import BlankLayout from "./layouts/pages/Blank";
import DefaultFormLayout from "./layouts/forms/DefaultFormLayout";

// Ultimately, theme and layouts need to be registered via their respective plugins.
// To learn more, see: https://www.webiny.com/docs/page-builder/theming/introduction.
export default () => [
    new ThemePlugin(theme),
    
    new PbPageLayoutPlugin({
        name: "static",
        title: "Static page",
        component: StaticLayout
    }),    

+   new PbPageLayoutPlugin({
+       name: "blank",
+       title: "Blank page",
+       component: StaticLayout
+   }),
    
    new FbFormLayoutPlugin({
        name: "default",
        title: "Default form layout",
        component: DefaultFormLayout
    })
];
```

With the above code in place, we should be able to create a new page and select the **Blank page** layout:
