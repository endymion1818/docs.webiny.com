</Alert>

By default, every Webiny project includes the default website theme which defines different visual aspects of your website, for example the default set of colors, typography, the default page layout, and more.

In a new Webiny project, if we were to open the [`apps/theme`](#) folder and in it the [`apps/theme/index.ts`](#) file, we'd see the following: 

```ts apps/theme/index.ts
import { PbPageLayoutPlugin } from "@webiny/app-page-builder";
import { FbFormLayoutPlugin } from "@webiny/app-form-builder";
import { ThemePlugin } from "@webiny/app-website";

// The central theme object which defines different visual aspects of your website,
// for example the default set of colors, typography, breakpoints, and more.
import theme from "./theme";

// Default layouts used by Page Builder pages and Form Builder forms.
import StaticLayout from "./layouts/pages/Static";
import DefaultFormLayout from "./layouts/forms/DefaultFormLayout";

// Ultimately, theme and layouts need to be registered via their respective plugins.
// To learn more, see: https://www.webiny.com/docs/page-builder/theming/introduction.
export default () => [
    new ThemePlugin(theme),
    
    new PbPageLayoutPlugin({
        name: "static",
        title: "Static page",
        component: StaticLayout
    }),
    
    new FbFormLayoutPlugin({
        name: "default",
        title: "Default form layout",
        component: DefaultFormLayout
    })
];
```

Respectively, via the [`ThemePlugin`](#), [`PbPageLayoutPlugin`](#), and [`FbFormLayoutPlugin`](#) plugins, the file achieves the following:

1. registers the central theme object
2. registers the **Static page** layout, to be used with pages created with the Page Builder application
3. registers the **Default form layout** layout, to be used with forms created with the Form Builder application

In the following sections, we cover the theme object and page layouts. If you're interested in form layouts, please visit the separate [Form Builder Theming](/docs/{version}/form-builder/theming/introduction) section of articles.
